# Setting Up Your React App

Follow these two simple steps to get the app running on your local machine:

## Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and update it with your specific settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open the `.env` file in your text editor and update the values as needed.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

Once these steps are complete, you can start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev

```

The app should now be running on your local development server!
